## CHNT30 Abstract

### Cultural Heritage in FAIRyland? How to LODify geodata in QGIS?

How can Linked Open Data (LOD) be practically applied and taught in archaeological and cultural heritage contexts using QGIS? This poster introduces FAIRyland, a fictional landscape located “somewhere near Sweden during the Minion Period”, developed as an educational playground for geodata processing and FAIRification practices. Inspired by existing training datasets such as AtlantGIS (https://github.com/kacebe/AtlantGIS), FAIRyland enables users to creatively simulate geospatial workflows within a narrative framework.

The fictional setting serves as a sandbox to demonstrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, including how to structure geodata, transform it into LOD, and interlink it with existing knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. Using the open-source SPARQLing Unicorn QGIS Plugin, georeferenced features in FAIRyland – such as meteor craters, ancient roads, mythical input zones, and even archaeological meatball sites – are semantically enriched and linked to Wikidata.

The poster showcases good practices for cultural heritage data training: creating narrative-driven geodata, applying SPARQL queries in QGIS, transforming vector layers to RDF, and generating FAIR metadata. It encourages the community to contribute datasets via GitHub and develop tutorials under open licences. Using playful but technically valid examples, FAIRyland becomes a collaborative testing ground for learning to use semantic web technologies in archaeology.

Ultimately, this poster argues for the power of fictional yet structured data to teach core skills in geoinformatics and semantic modelling, promoting Open Science and reusable workflows in cultural heritage data management.
